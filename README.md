# NUS Digital Twin Scripts

Quick and dirty scripts I use to help clean and process data for [NUS Digital Twin](https://www.nus-digital-twin.com/).


- [`clean-energy-use`](/clean-energy-use/): To convert energy use data from ClimateStudio in `.csv` to `.json` for display.
- [`extract-features`](/extract-features/): To clean building data from [overpass turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/). Takes in and outputs a `.json` file.
- [`colors`](/colors/): Generates color palettes, using seaborn. `distance-color.py` generates colors for the color by distance feature.
